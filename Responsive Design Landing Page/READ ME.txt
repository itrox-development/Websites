This is a concept page i have written designed to make a user download a digital marketing E-BOOK.
I have written some jQuery and Javascript for a bit of animation functionality of the
mobile menu the header when scrolling and of the "success stories" images.

Other page element aniations are handled with animate it CSS and the pafe is build on
flexbox GRID and Media queries.
